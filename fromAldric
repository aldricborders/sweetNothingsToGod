1.
Oh what great Love you are! 
Why do words elude me? My heart speaks yet my mind can not perceive its sayings.
From their overflow my mouth utters 10,000 tounges; but with a few intelligible words, instruct me in the Love from which they are sprung. 
From our hearts you call into being all our days past, weighing in your balnace that which is vain against that which lasts.
In harmony our hearts pour crys and you paint the picture of their voices; look and see, out of the image of your sons and your daughters,  behold the site of many rushing waters.
Tell me, is it your voice you hear flowing when you listen to the picture of man; please keep speaking, thoughts are now appearing which my mind can understand.
When you gaze into your mirror, are we the reflection you see?
Father is this why when you obey your Word to love yourself, it's the same as loving me?
I understand now; my heart's joys I CAN recite.
"One Father, One Son, One Spirit and One Humanity unite."
